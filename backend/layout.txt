Phase 1: The Core (Done ✅)
Initialize Node/Express

Setup .env and server.js

Test: Run nodemon server.js. If you see "Server Online," we move on.

Phase 2: Data Blueprint (Next Step 🔜)
Build config/db.js: Connect to MongoDB.

Build models/User.js: Define what a user is.

Test: Verify server console says "MongoDB Connected."

Phase 3: Identity & Security
Build controllers/authController.js: Write the "Register" logic.

Build routes/authRoutes.js: Link the URL to the logic.

Test: Use a tool (like Postman/Thunder Client) to send a user to the DB. Check MongoDB to see if they appeared.

Phase 4: Mission Logic
Build models/Job.js

Build controllers/jobController.js (The CRUD functions).

Build routes/jobRoutes.js

Test: Try to "Post" a job and "Get" all jobs via API.

Phase 5: The Lock (Authorization)
Build middleware/authMiddleware.js.

Apply to Job Routes: Ensure only logged-in users can see jobs.

Test: Try to get jobs without a token. It should say "Access Denied."

🚦 Testing Checklist for each Step
Before telling me "Next," always check:

[ ] Does the terminal show any Red Errors?

[ ] Did I save all files?

[ ] Is the MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist set to "Allow Access from Anywhere"?
